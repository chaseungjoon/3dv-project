class HMGConfigHelper:
    """
    Helper class for multi-inheritance scenarios, specifically designed to support task configuration
    and environment interaction in robotic manipulation tasks.

    Example Usage:
        This class is intended to be used in multi-inheritance cases such as:
            class ExampleLocoManipulationEnv(LocoManipulationEnv, HMGConfigHelper)
        which will automatically generate a new configuration class:
            class PnPCounterToSink_Config(MG_Config)

    Behavior:
    1. In the implementation of the MG_RoboSuiteHumanoidGeneric class:
        - `self.env` will be an instance of PnPCounterToSink, enabling access to:
            - `self.env.get_object()` to retrieve key objects.
            - `self.env.get_subtask_term_signals()` to obtain signal information.
    2. In the implementation of PnPCounterToSink_Config:
        - `self.task_config()` delegates to `PnPCounterToSink.task_config`, which defines
          subtask divisions based on objects and signals.

    Attributes:
        subclasses (list): A list storing tuples of subclass names and their respective classes.
